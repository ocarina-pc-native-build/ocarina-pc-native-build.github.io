# DKB Recomp plan

Goal: *Donkey Kong Bananza* (Switch 2, base 1.0.0) playable on Windows as a static recompilation, built on
[TotK Recomp](https://github.com/valentderah/totk-pc-recomp). No game files in the repository: each user dumps their
own cartridge and the build runs on their machine.

Known input: the base ExeFS has `main` (md5 f68752f5…, the binary GRAnimated/DKBananza's BinSync uses) and `sdk`, no
`subsdk0`. Update 458752 has another layout and is not supported yet. The RomFS is about 19 GB.

Each phase ends in a milestone someone else can check. The order follows the critical path.

## F0 — CPU: lifter and build (done)

- The TotK lifter runs on Bananza: 133,806 functions in `main`, 46,255 in `sdk`.
- ARMv8.3 instructions the Switch 2 code uses (commit 3941578): `retab`/`retaa`/`braa`/`blraa` as branches without
  authentication, `ldapr*` as `ldar*`, PAC hints as NOP. Each new class has a differential test against Unicorn.
- **Milestone reached:** all of `main` and `sdk` lift with no unsupported instruction, compile and link.

## F1 — OS: Horizon on Switch 2 (done)

- NSO loader for Switch 2 modules (RELR, MOD0), TLS, memory layout, `main.npdm`.
- TotK Recomp's host (threads, IPC, file system and RomFS, time, account, applet) with the Switch 2 `GetInfo` ids,
  the 9 GiB memory pool, `IAudioDevice` 19-21, `IAudioRenderer` 12-14 and the Switch 2 `oe`/`vi`/`account` calls.
- **Milestone reached:** the game leaves `nnMain`, mounts the RomFS and reaches its first NVN call.

## F2 — NVN 2 with a null renderer (done)

- NVN 2 bootstrap and proc table read from the game's own `sdk` (the driver is linked into the game, as on Switch 1).
  529 of the 700 entry points share NVN 1's names; the 171 new ones are listed in
  [bananza-nvn-new-procs.txt](bananza-nvn-new-procs.txt).
- With `TOTK_GPU=null` the main loop runs at 20 fps, audio plays and controller input arrives.
- **Milestone reached:** the game loop runs without a picture.

## F3 — Shaders: Ampere to SPIR-V (done for the first scene)

- Eglantine's Ampere-to-Maxwell lowering (`runtime/third_party/eglantine/`, GPL) runs at `nvnProgramSetShaders`. Its
  output goes to TotK Recomp's Maxwell translator (Ryujinx's, `tools/xlate/`) and comes out as SPIR-V.
- Fixes on top of Eglantine are marked "DKB Recomp" in its files. Translator fixes are patches in
  `tools/xlate/patches/`. Notes: [bananza-shaders.md](bananza-shaders.md).
- **Milestone reached:** every shader of the first 3D scene lowers and translates (4,820 of 4,820 stages).

## F4 — Vulkan back end (done for the first scene)

- NVN 2 compute constant bank c0 packed per program from the control section counts. Shared memory size read from
  the control. Bank 17 holds the Switch 2 blit parameters.
- Every single-sample colour texture can be used as a storage image, because NVN 2 does not ask for it.
- **Milestone reached:** the title screen and the tutorial cave render (2,600 frames, 0 validation errors).

## F5 — Playable (in progress)

- [x] Controller input in the menu and in gameplay (walking, punching). Keyboard and mouse come from TotK Recomp's
      input layer ([controls.md](controls.md)).
- [x] Audio: the game's audio renderer (REV15) mixes on the host and plays through SDL3. In a 90 s tutorial run,
      `TOTK_TRACE=audio` measured an RMS of 0.02 to 0.04 and peaks up to 0.41 once gameplay starts, with no underrun
      or overrun.
- [x] Tutorial guide movies: `nn::codec` VP9 decoding on the host with libvpx (`runtime/ov_codec.c`).
- [ ] GPU fault (an invalid instruction pointer; the freeze was the same fault, 86fb7cc) right after the first guide
      movie frame. It is the first draw of one instanced light-quad vertex shader, and its fragment stage (one of the
      123 that read a storage buffer at c0+0x530) does not matter. Its fragment code, its data and rasterisation are
      ruled out; leaving out only the draw command passes. Leaving out that shader moves the fault to another vertex
      shader of the same light-quad family. Seen on NVIDIA 617.14 (a crash inside the driver's shader compiler),
      617.42 and 621.01. Mitigated (84a8f7d, `TOTK_FIX_VS_FAULT`): the quads with ten instance streams are skipped on
      NVIDIA. The later fault (about 2 runs in 4, also with synchronous pipeline builds) follows one more quad of the
      same shape, NVN 2 vertex stage cae0ef8e9fe9147f, which is skipped too (6da41ba): 0 faults in 6 runs of 600 s
      since. The cause is still open: its vertex input and SPIR-V match quads that never fault. [#9]
- [x] Partial stencil clears (write mask other than 0xff): a full-screen triangle replaces only the masked bits (#36,
      by monsterlag).
- [x] `nvnCommandBufferPush{Graphics,Compute}Constants`: recorded (33628c7). Graphics root table 0 is bank 24, read by
      the full-screen blits, which now get the pushed `{1/w, 1/h, w, h}`. Compute root tables sit in the packed c0
      after its 16-byte head, each padded to 16 bytes, with the word counts from the shader control (#20, by
      monsterlag): the upscaler's two image rectangles are root table 0, pushed by the game. [#2]
- [x] Colour grading: the 3D LUT is filled (8x8x8 R11G11B10F, checked in the mining tunnel); the empty LUT was an old build. [#4]
- [ ] Some textures look blocky (checkerboard rocks) [#5]: the deswizzle now uses the Switch 2 GOB layout, which fixes the gold rock in the tutorial cave; the other rock surfaces still need a check.
- [ ] Getting past the tutorial cave. [#7] A hand-played run reached the Ingot Isle Cave-In section; respawning
      there stalled the GPU.
- [ ] Destructible terrain renders black. [#45] Its indirect records are now reset on the host in replay order
      (#48, `TOTK_FIX_INDIRECT_RESET`), which should also end the garbage arguments behind the respawn stall in
      #10 (not retested yet). The index counts come from the geometry stage, still to be lowered and run. Ordinary
      geometry shaders now translate and cache under an explicit topology contract (#49, #50), and replay behind
      `TOTK_EXPERIMENTAL_GEOMETRY=1` (#52). The translator also accepts a portable passthrough subset (#54). The
      terrain's geometry stage is passthrough, and the replay still rejects it until #55 lands.
- [x] Saves: the game writes `progress.sav`, `caption.sav` and `config.sav` as it plays, and a later run on the same
      profile offers Continue and resumes at the last checkpoint (the mining tunnel of the tutorial).
- [x] Performance in the tutorial: the game picks its own present interval (1 to 3 vsyncs) from how long its frames
  take. A profile of the render thread found the #9 skip's stage-name lookup taking 72 % of it (fixed in d5fd595), and
  the host's hold of each present until its display time made the job workers' mid-frame GPU reads wait for vsync
  (off for Bananza since 69d51d0). A 600 s run of the scripted test now runs at 59.4 to 60.0 fps in every minute after
  the first. Other areas and other GPUs are not measured yet.
- [ ] Testing on other GPUs. [#3]
- [x] Installer on TotK Recomp's model (`docs/installer.md`, #19): from the user's base 1.0.0 ExeFS and RomFS folders
      it packs the RomFS, builds the shader translator, lifts with the patch table and builds `dkb100`, run from this
      checkout with the documented toolchain. A release package is not made yet. [#8]

- **Milestone:** play from the start to the end of the first level without a crash.

## Later

- NVN 2 calls the host accepts and does not record yet (`runtime/nvn_api_nvn2.c`, `NVN2_NOT_RECORDED`): mesh shaders,
  variable-rate shading, DLSS, ray tracing, device command buffers. Each one is logged on its first call. None of
  them has mattered so far.
- Game update 458752.
- Linux, which TotK Recomp's toolchain supports.

## Alongside

- Symbols in [GRAnimated/DKBananza](https://github.com/GRAnimated/DKBananza) (nerve names, BinSync), which help debug
  every phase.
- Following Eden, oboromi, NeXo2 and any other NVN 2 work, and crediting what is used.

## Rules

- Nothing from the game in git: no ExeFS, RomFS, generated C, extracted shaders or screenshots with game assets.
- Licences: see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), "Reusing code".
- Small pull requests, one topic each, with honest numbers.
